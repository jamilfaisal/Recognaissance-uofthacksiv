With the rise of IoT devices and the backbone support of the emerging 5G technology, BVLOS drone flights are becoming more readily available. According to CBInsights, Gartner, IBISworld, this US$3.34B market has the potential for growth and innovation.

How It Works:
Reconnaissance drone software that utilizes custom object recognition and machine learning to track wanted targets. It performs close to real-time speed with nearly 100% accuracy and allows a single operator to operate many drones at once. Bundled with a light sleek-designed web interface, it is highly inexpensive to maintain and easy to operate.

There is a Snapdragon Dragonboard that runs physically on the drones capturing real-time data and processing the video feed to identify targets. Identified targets are tagged and sent to an operator that is operating several drones at a time. This information can then be relayed to the appropriate parties.
